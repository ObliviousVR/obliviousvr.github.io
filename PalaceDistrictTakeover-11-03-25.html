        <h2> </h2>
        
        <p><b>ZAPHIRA, PALACE DISTRICT</b> – The Palace District is in a state of upheaval following the Hemwick Agency's hostile takeover. While the agency promises a new era of prosperity and reform, critics decry the move as a tyrannical power grab.</p>
        
        <p>The Lower Zaphiran council has officially endorsed the takeover, citing the need to restore order to the long-neglected district. However, this decision has been met with fierce resistance from residents and palace district businesses who view it as a betrayal.</p>
        
        <blockquote>"The council's decision is a betrayal of the people," decried a displaced palace district citizen. "They've traded our freedom for a mercenary's boot on our necks."</blockquote>
        
        <p>Hemwick Agency mercenaries and undead operatives have established a heavy presence throughout the district, enforcing strict curfews and prohibiting public gatherings. Protests have been met with deadly force, and reports of civilian casualties continue to surface.</p>
        
        <p>Despite the violence, the Hemwick Agency insists that its presence will bring much-needed improvements to the Palace District. They have promised economic stability, debt recovery plans, and massive investments in education and healthcare.</p>
        
        <blockquote>"We are committed to restoring order and ensuring the safety of all residents," stated Councilman Hemwick. "Any resistance will be met with necessary force."</blockquote>
        
        <p>Councilman Hemwick has also laid out a series of political stances, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Religious, sexual, and gender freedom</li>
          <li>Encouragement of the arts, education, and mental health</li>
          <li>Discouragement of vices and humanoid slavery</li>
          <li>Plans for future reforms</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The sudden shift in power has left many residents in a state of shock and fear. Businesses are shuttered, and the once vibrant atmosphere of the Palace District has been replaced by a chilling silence punctuated by the sound of gunfire and the whir of surveillance drones.</p>
        
        <p>The international community has yet to issue a formal response. Some observers suggest that the Hemwick Agency's move may have been long pre-meditated and done with support from those within the council's inner circles.</p>
        
        <p>The future of the Palace District hangs in the balance. Whether Hemwick’s regime can maintain control, or whether the simmering resentment will erupt into full-scale rebellion, remains to be seen.</p>
